### Challenge 
How many refugees are moving towards Europe at this time? If we knew the answer to this question we would be better prepared to assist people – on the road as well as at destination points.

Could a global tracking tool be developed? Perhaps we can register mobile phone signals to understand patterns and predict how many people are on the move to where?

This suggestion from the Danish Refugee Council is an example of problems we will address when we put talent together at OpenHack. Take the challenge and make an impact. Join in and code for humanity the 4th-6th of December.
