### Brief description
Connecting people looking for housing, people looking for jobs and employers looking for employees and landlords looking for tenants on the same platform.

### Background
Hyresgästföreningen is a Swedish union of tenants. We are a membership organization. We answer questions and provide support to members in dealing with landlords. We negotiate with landlords concerning rents an terms of housing condition (regardless of tenants being members or not). We work with opinion-shaping and lobby policymakers to improve conditions for tenants. One of our priorities is the right for everyone to have an affordable housing.

### Challenge
The challenge is to create a platform where, free of charge, people looking for housing, people looking for a job, landlords and employers can share what they have and what they want and either match directly or cross match depending on needs.

At any given moment there are people looking for somewhere to live. Either because they lack housing or because their housing doesn't meet their needs (to small, to big, to far away, to expensive etc). At the same time there are also people looking for a job or a new job. Sometimes both categories of people are the same. Sometimes they differ.

While people are looking for housing and jobs, companies/landlords are looking for employees/tenants. A commonly heard of problem is students and workers that have been either accepted to an university or have been offered a job but they lack housing near or even in commutable distance to university/job. The lack of housing results in not being able to attend the university or accept the job offer. This is something that is negative for every involved part as well as society in general.

Right now:

* someone who is looking for rented housing searches sites focused on housing (for example Boplats in Gothenburg) or contacts landlords directly, inquiring for something to rent.
* landlords looking for a tenant uses before mentioned sites (Boplats...) or have an internal way of looking/choosing.
* employers and employees looking to employ use Arbetsförmedlingen, LinkedIn, Monster etc.

Our challenge is to connect people looking for housing (W), people looking for jobs (X) and employers looking for employees (Y) and landlords looking for tenants (Z) on the same platform (ZWYX), enabling them to share what they want and what they have. If a match between needs and wants occur a swap could be made.

### Goals
Freedom to find affordable housing where you want to work.

### End-user
People who are looking for housing and/or jobs, companies/landlords who are looking for employees/tenants.
