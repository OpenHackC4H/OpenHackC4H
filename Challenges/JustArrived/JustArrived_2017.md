### Brief description
Today institutions provide the information required to get a job, end-to-end. You can find bits of information on different sites provided by Arbetsförmedlingen, Skatteverket, Migrationsverket, Försäkringskassan, etc. We all love and use services such as Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. They’ve tapped into the knowledge of many and made information accessible to hundreds of millions of people across the world. Literally changing the landscape of information access. Could a knowledge base for jobseekers be created?

### Background
JustArrived is an organisation that connects newly-arrived immigrants with Swedish companies. Their digital platform enables companies to post simple tasks and services and match them with newcomers looking for work. JustArrived’s case raises the issue many newly-arrived immigrants face when trying to learn how the Swedish labour markets works. 

#### Just Arrived - We guide, empower and connect
The mission of Just Arrived is enrich and empower the labor market by guiding, empowering and connecting foreign-born competence with the staffing needs of Swedish companies. We envision ourselves being the most trusted go-to place for all foreign-born in need of work. Built up by over 200 volunteers, representing 60 companies and authorities in Sweden, we now work with over 100 customers and have users from over 100 countries, speaking more than 80 different languages.

### Challenge
On a daily basis we come in contact with tons of people and many (if not all) of them face the same challenge: How can I find more information and/or a guide on how I can get my first job i Sweden?
Today institutions provide the information required to get a job, end-to-end. You can find bits of information on different sites provided by Arbetsförmedlingen, Skatteverket, Migrationsverket, Försäkringskassan, etc. Thing is, they all provide different interfaces and can be very hard to find (and not all of them are even up to date!).


### The mission: a crowdsourced knowledge base
We all love and use services such as Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. They’ve tapped into the knowledge of many and made information accessible to hundreds of millions of people across the world. Literally changing the landscape of information access. Could a knowledge base for jobseekers be created?

* Mission 1: Could the best guides and information be curated by harvesting insights from the many? 
* Mission 2: Also, is it possible to curate the best information from different authorities and institutions and present it in one place?
Bonus: Conceptualize how users can rate/vote/give feedback on content?

### Goals
**Create the go to-place**
We strongly believe that by guiding and empowering users with knowledge, they will be able to find their first job opportunity on their own, or through us, and much faster than by any other means. Can you create an application that can become the go-to place to find qualitative, and up to date, guides and information to all jobseekers? Provide users with a “recipe” for how to get into the Swedish labor market, and in the future, other labour market(s).

### Constraints
We all believe in the web. It’s open, searchable, linkable and accessible in a way that native apps, frankly, are not. Since we want to get this information in the hands of the many we would very much like to see this developed as a web application, we don’t want users to be left out just because they are on “the wrong platform”.

### End-user
Foreign-born job-seekers
