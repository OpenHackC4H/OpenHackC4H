## Platform for Data Transmission/Synchronization, Integration and Monitoring

*Originally Published for OpenHack@Malmö2015*

*”What we need is a streamlined integration and execution platform that enables a simple process to develop, manage, monitor and extend systems, integrations, data flows and data synchronization for global projects in low resource areas and geographically dispersed IT environment.”*

### Background
In humanitarian contexts many times organizations have built themselves into an unmanageable environment of IT systems where they continuously struggling with collection and access to relevant data. Continuous new demands for functionality, growing infrastructures and increasing numbers of systems and tools increases the complexity in this contexts and sometimes makes it difficult if not even impossible to manage and control the data flows.

Very often, it-environment in this contexts are geographically scattered with very low or absent connectivity to internet. There is a strong need for controlling the data flows in these environments with logging, monitoring and overviewing applications, activities and processes.

* Large number of systems and integrations on various platforms
* Scattered technologies and solutions
* Lack of monitoring, logging and statistics
* Lacking overview of systematic activities, data flows and integrations – ”black box”
* Individual or vendor dependent
* Difficult to expand or improve existing systems
* High cost for development and maintenance
* High complexity
* Scattered development, many different platforms and technologies
* Versioning and compatibility problems
* Lack of test for integration and synchronization solutions
* Requires heavy ongoing maintenance as complexity increases
* Laborious and redundant data entry
* Large amounts of data currently collected outside the official systems – this data mostly lost

### Objectives
We want to offer an alternative to the variety of different software solutions that exist in areas such as data transmission/synchronization, integration and monitoring and introduce a new, streamlined and especially easy way to continuous add new functionality for and integration capabilities and with great overview and security of the infrastructure, regardless of whether the systems are cloud-based, on-premises or deployed in a field project far away.

### Achievement
* Consistent process for the development of integrations and extended functionality
* A standard process for integrations and data flows
* Testable integrations and flows, all flows needs to follow easy and maintainable test routines and
ability to run in ”testmode”
* Quick and easy installation and upgrades – ”One click install” to deploy new flows to the server
instances
* Real time monitoring, visualization, alarms and statistics for activities
* Configurable dashboards based on role and individual interests
* Overview of all systems integrations and system flows
* Standardized configuration of flows
* Centralized scheduling, configuration and deployment of new flows
* Overview of activities and execution flows
