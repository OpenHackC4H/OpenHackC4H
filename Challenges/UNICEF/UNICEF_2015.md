### How can we improve the registration of children from remote areas?
In a number of countries around the world, households fail to register at least one of their children at birth. Children whose births are unregistered are in danger of being denied access to essential social services, such as education and health services, and protection from violence, exploitation, and child labor. It follows that apart from being the first legal acknowledgement of a child’s existence, birth registration is fundamental to the realization of a number of rights and benefits. Experience from countries like Uganda, Senegal, and Brazil shows that involving community workers and mobile technologies can help close the gap to 100% registered births.

Bottlenecks in the attempt to register all children:
* High cost of birth registration.
* Lack of public awareness about the critical importance of registering children or the appropriate channels to do so, especially among socially excluded groups (refugees, internally displaced populations, ethnic minorities, etc.).
* Lack of integration of registration services in health centers.
* Geographical inaccessibility, as most people in rural areas live at least 10 km away from the nearest registry office.
* Continuing home births in remote areas.
* Lack of an alternative system for the authorities to “capture” the children who are not registered through the official system.

Strategies to consider:
* Include innovative technologies, such as RapidSMS in Nigeria.
* Organizing mobile registration campaigns.
