### Brief description
Graphic visualization of possibilities for jobseekers using competence matching tools.

### Background
In 2015 there were 796,000 available jobs in our job bank. The number of registered jobseekers amounted in 2015 to just under 676,000 people, of which 379 000 is unemployed. In Sweden we now have a situation where we both have a relatively high unemployment rate and at the same time a high number of vacancies. This indicates a possibility in increasing the matching rate. Arbetsförmedlingen is therefore shifting its matching focus from profession-orientation to a competence and skill-based orientation.

### Challenges
Professional roles and job titles have different meanings both within and outside a specific industry, and also over the time.

* Can we make jobseekers and employers more interested in exploring and using skills and competencies in the recruitment process instead of using roles and jobtitles?
* Can we use gamification as a trigger for creating more interest in the labor market? (Arbetsförmedlingen have used gamification in a pilot project www.kompetensutmaningen.se)
* The visualization should focus on insights more than geographical data.

### Goals
We want to ensure that we have a well-functioning labor market and an unemployment as low as possible in Sweden In order to achieve that we want companies to effectively find people with the right skills and competencies interdisciplinary.

### End-user
Primarily jobseekers but also employers
