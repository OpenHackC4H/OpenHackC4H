### Brief description
Create a digital solution that makes it easier to employ or to find a job that matches peoples different capacities. Develop an innovative solution that will make workplaces more accessible to everyone.

### Background
Arbetsförmedlingen is the Swedish government agency mainly responsible for the public employment service in Sweden and the implementation labour market policies. They have the biggest database of job seekers in Sweden and you have access to their APIs, widgets and datasets when working on the case. Arbetsförmedlingen’s case raises the question: how can we view disabilities as an advantage in the labour market?

### Challenge
#### Challenges and problem statement
How can we make employers see and utilize the power and skills in their candidates?

#### Background
In Sweden we have a situation where we both have a relatively high unemployment rate and at the same time a high number of vacancies. Among the unemployed there are a large number of people with great potentials but often seen as having disabilities. This indicates a possibility in increasing the matching rate. Many employers feel uncertain about what it means to recruit people with disabilities. Functionalities are perceived as a hard-judged factor in recruitment cases. The consequence may be that a disability gets too much attention and overrides the more relevant question of which skills and conditions to cope with the work that the applicant has.  Some companies has instead taken advantage of that such as:
* The British intelligence service actively recruits people with dyslexia. It has been found that they are unusually good at breaking codes and analyzing images.
* IT companies like to hire people with autism, as they often have an unusual ability to see details. One example is Unicus  http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressreleases/unikt-norskt-foeretag-startar-i-stockholm-1748964 

Computer gaming and is also an underestimated skill that can, and should, be used as an advantage in the job market. http://www.nyteknik.se/ingenjorskarriar/spela-dig-till-dromjobbet-6845743 

Virtual reality is another way for exposing skills by focusing on other things than your physical appearance https://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/For-arbetssokande/Tips-och-rad/Nyheter/Nyheter-for-Arbetssokande/2017-04-14-Jobbintervjuer-med-VR-teknik-i-nytt-grepp.html

They have launched a joint innovations competition where every winner will receive expert support and financing up to a total of SEK 2 million.
