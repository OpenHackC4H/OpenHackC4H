### Brief description
New portal for jobbmatching. Easy, effective recrutment without CV.

### Background
Many companies and organizations have discussed and they all agree on that we need an easier way to find the right person for them in the recruitment process. They have all experienced that education is not the same as competence. To recruit someone they need to read hundreds of CV:s which take a lot of interviews and tests. This takes a lot of time and they still really don’t know if the candidate is the right for the job. They all feel that it is hard to show the candidates in an early state why they should choose their company.

### Challenge
How can we create a portal that is able to see personality and real skills instead of just lines in a CV? How can the employer give a deeper picture of the company than some lines in the webpage or in an ad?
It should be possible to verify skills and competence with practical tests, digital environment with VR for personality tests (for example DISC). Tests in problem-solving and so on.
The employer should also be able to show soft values in the company in this portal. Companies have to give more input in this portal in another way than in a traditional ad.

### Goals
More diversity in the recruitment process. It will be easier to show  personality and skills to the employer. It will also be easier for the employer to show what it's like to work in the company. What will you get except salary?

### End-user
All employers who experienced that their recruitment process is too complicated today and feel that they lose opportunity of fantastic candidates because of this. Job-seekers of all kind that feels that they are more than their CV.
