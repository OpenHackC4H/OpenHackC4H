# CHALLENGE FROM JOBTECH

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTIVE
Help job seekers to explore the labour market by making a graphic visualization.

### BACKGROUND
Every day a person goes to a job they dislike or have no job to go to at all, is a loss. Not only for the individual, but also for the employer who has the potential to grow if they find the right person. This is not something Sweden can afford.

In Sweden we have a situation where we both have a relatively high unemployment rate and at the same time a high number of vacancies. This indicates an opportunity in increasing the matching rate. At the same time, the job market is changing rapidly with focus shifting from profession-orientation to a competence and skill-based orientation in an expanding gig economy (see Arbetsförmedlingen and Futurion)

### CHALLENGE
On a single day, you can find up to 100 000 available jobs in Platsbanken or any other matching application on the market. Today we are applying machine-learning tools to make it easier to match your competencies but you can only access it in a textual way.

Today modern tech allows for visualization and data-driven graphical representations of the labour market and all available jobs in a whole new way. Openhack in Lund 2016 started building a platform which can be used as an inspiration or as a starting point (​[github](https://github.com/data-universe/data-universe])​, [​data universe​](https://data-universe.github.io/)). We want you to help us think of new and inspiring ways of utilising the possibilities or to expand on the data universe project and take it to a whole new level.

### GOALS
Create a mindblowing application that attracts job seekers to explore the labour market and thereby becoming a better service provider for those jobseekers that find text-based exploration problematic or tiresome.

### END-USERS
Jobseekers
   
### FUTURE PLANS
We believe that rather than separate systems for job matching, we strive for a digital ecosystem where services from different vendors can flourish together making superior opportunities for job seekers and employers. The heart of the ecosystem consists of a number of core components that leads to better customer services. By providing these ecosystem core components we want to continue market competition, but at a higher level and faster pace.
