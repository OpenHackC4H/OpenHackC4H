### Background
Refugee Tech is a community based in Stockholm with the mission to to use technology to connect, collaborate, and innovate in order to solve problems faced by refugees today and in the future. This challenge has been developed in one of their workshops where they focus on eliciting current and relevant problems faced by the refugees.

### Introduction
A 2013 worldwide study published by Forbes* found that 80% of jobs were obtained through professional networking. The majority of these jobs were not even advertised publicly.
The process of building a professional network often starts early, at school events for example, and slowly grows year by year as you get recommended to a company or are noticed for your skills. Attending events and conferences related to a specific skillset will further develop this network.

This makes it easy  to understand the struggle for newcomers in Sweden when they search for jobs relevant to their skills without much luck. They haven’t had enough time to develop relevant professional contacts in their new country.

The networking process can take years and is not a reliable way for newcomers to find employment opportunities. Given that professional networking is the key to most of the country’s jobs, it is not fair to newcomers, who are left without a network in their new country, despite possessing years of equal professional experience & skills in their field.

When newcomers are denied the tools they need in order to integrate, the result is often depression, low self-esteem, and a loss of motivation to contribute to the new society. This also makes it even harder to obtain whatever jobs might be available.

If we make it possible to establish these essential professional networks for newcomers, we would be giving them the foundation they need to reach their full potential in their new societies!

### Challenge
Help us reach this untapped source of skills by enabling newcomers to build a relevant professional network in Sweden!

### Plausible idea
* Encourage larger Swedish companies and municipalities to organize specific events for newcomers to learn about the Swedish labor market and working environment
* Create a matching platform to pair refugees with professional Swedish mentors from their same professional background so that they can meet and exchange knowledge & experience
* Provide adaptable information packages to newcomers, which should be personalized to the professional background and/or skills of the individual.
