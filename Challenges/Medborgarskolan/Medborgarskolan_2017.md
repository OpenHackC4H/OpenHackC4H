### Brief description
How can we help an employer to dare and to increase the knowledge of employing people with functional variations?

### Background
Medborgarskolan offers a lot of educations and work for opportunities for all people to grow and to get a meaningful work life. Medborgarskolan also offers labor market projects for people with function variations. We also meet a lot of employers who has got very limited knowledge of functional variations. They don't know what kind of support they can get and what is required when they employ someone with function variations.

### Challenge
With need a solution for employers so that they easily can understand different functional variations and what they need to do when they employ someone. They also need to understand how much competence the can lose if they don't include people with functional variations.

### Goals
More people with functional variations will be employed and we won't miss all this competence. People with functional variations will be able to work with right kinds of work tasks. Right person in the right place.

### End-user
