### Brief description
Ease the everyday life of parents to kids with functional variations.

### Background
I3tex strives to make the world a better place. In order to achieve this, I3tex lets its employees work on ”Better World” projects. Better World projects have the person in focus and aims to lessen the burden of everyday life, increase security, ease suffering and improve communication between people. All this while keeping the environmental impact to a minimum. For parents to kids with functional variations, one of the most crucial aspects of everyday life revolves around organizing and relay parts of their child’s well being to other parties involved in the child’s life (such as teachers, doctors, etc.).

### Challenge
To be a parent is tough work, it requires that you are organized, supportive and caring towards your child. If your child has a functional variation your role as a parent becomes even more challenging. More things now need to be coordinated while your vigilance and patience needs to be on point.

Life for a parent is filled with Post It notes that are easily lost, a constant jump between Email and text messages to keep in touch with different people, checklists that are easy to loose. To communicate changes in the state of your child, which lead to changes in routines and everything has to be done over again. The worries that arise in the subsequent chaos affects both parents and child. All these aspects lead to a sea of stuff ”todo” and ”keep track of”, which in turn makes life as a parent, a partner, a colleague, a friend and even as yourself, really tough.There is groups online that contribute with a lot of useful information for parents through social media or webpages (a prime example is www.funktionskompassen.se). Something that is lacking is effective and practical tools for parents to kids
with functional variations.

How can existing (or new) technical solutions along with an insight to the target groups wishes be integrated into an easy to use tool?

### Goals
The goal is to provide a tool that solves the problem a parent to a child with functional variations encounters daily.

The solution needs to be dynamic as to adapt to the ever changing state of the child. The solution should as such not put an unreasonable strain on the parent should an unexpected (or expected) situation arise.

### End-user
