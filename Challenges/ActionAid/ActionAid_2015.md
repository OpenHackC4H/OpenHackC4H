### Background
ActionAid is an international federation with presence in 48 countries. Focus is on bottom-up participation and campaigning within the following thematic priorities:
1. Women’s access and control over land and natural resources and the promotion of climate resilient sustainable agriculture
2. Securing improvements in public service by holding governments and corporates to account
3. Quality education and youth engaged in fighting poverty
4. Build resilience and respond to disasters with people-centred alternatives
5. Women’s and girls breaking the cycle of poverty and violence

### Problem statement
The success of all the hopes and aspirations of ActionAid depends on our ability to create and facilitate awareness in all strands of society of how different things could be.

The traditional way of doing this among people living in poverty is through workshops and trainings using participatory and self-reflective methods and techniques, including drama and visual training materials. In order for politicians to be open to promote change they may also be subjected to trainings, in particular on local level to understand their duties as elected politicians as well as what may be in it for them (re-election). Local radio is also widely used to spread awareness of injustices and human rights. Middle class and political and economic elites are seldom targeted in this way but rather reached through media and political campaigns, often in relation to a particular law or government policy or performance or as part of election campaigns.

An interesting option in recent years to get a message across, and important for the point I’m about to make, is the use of soap operas, which is esteemed to have been highly effective in challenging conservative ideas regarding for example women’s status in society or people’s perception of homosexuals and discriminated ethnic groups. People did not watch these soap operas to get their perceptions turned upside down. They watch because it’s highly entertaining and built on cliff-hangers. These soap operas may not have reached the poorest of the poor, but not far from it, and by impacting the culturally influential middle class anything can trickle anywhere.

Unfortunately, collaborations between the development aid sector and soap opera makers are not too common, main reasons for that being that the making of a soap opera requires an investment NGOs find difficult to fund (and challenging to report impact from), and because development aid workers and soap opera makers probably don’t cross paths with each other that often. Lastly, one would expect certain TV producers to be very careful in compromising with the commercial aspects of a soap. Others, on the other hand, may well appreciate the commercial potential in shocking their audience and rattle the cage.

### Challenge
In five years, 90% of the world’s population above six years of age is expected to own a mobile phone, most of them smart. This is giving unprecedented potential access to everyone.

A simple challenge would be to transform the materials used for workshop into different Apps, which in part at least is already under way to an extent.

Such apps or websites could be about things such as (in order of ActionAid’s priorities above):
* farming techniques information and tips for starting small businesses
* registration of examples of poor public service or poor government performance, automatically sending to media and accountable government body
* making it possible for youth or anybody to join a political campaign on any topic
* learning a healthy lifestyle (obesity is not a problem of the developed countries alone) information on gender equality and masculinity

The question is, referring back to the example of the soap opera, can mobile phones somehow be used to introduce new ideas in an entertaining – I’m even tempted to use the word “addictive” – way, like the way people evidently get obsessed with certain games?

If we are to pick one particular challenge among the above it would be the one permeating all the others: male and female stereotypes and current inequality: a highly entertaining program or game app designed to challenge and break gender stereotypes and for all involved to see the justice as well as the opportunities in doing so.

Such a program may well have to be contextualized to each setting in order for maximum identification. On the other hand there is virtually no place on earth free from gender stereotypes and discrimination of women in all strands of society.

### Goal
That the development sector can use methods to change people’s values and attitudes way beyond the traditional and relatively small scale scope within the development aid sector of today.

### End-user
All people stuck in patriarchal structures, which may well be just about everybody, but in particular in countries where discrimination and oppression of women is most serious.
