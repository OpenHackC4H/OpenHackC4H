### Brief description
New digital means of engagement with ActionAid on issues of solidarity and social justice!

### Background
ActionAid International is a federation with presence in 48 countries supporting individuals, organizations and movements for human rights, democracy, social justice and gender equality, primarily focusing on youth and women. AA aims at being a locally rooted, feminist, political and courageous organization. AA is a global referent on issues of tax justice, climate change and equality, i.a. In our new strategy (2017-27) we aim to leave the North vs South development aid paradigm and become a go-to organization for social justice, applying and adjusting our strategies and tools to any context, including Sweden. So far engagement between ActionAid Sweden and the Swedish public has focused on fund-raising, without providing much space for other kinds of engagement, which is now the challenge we face.

### Challenge
We want to communicate with our supporters and collaborators through their smart phones to make it possible for them to:

* sign petitions to be sent to politicians, companies or other power holders, in Sweden or abroad
* join activities like demonstrations, manifestations, media stunts, etc.
* sign up to support an ActionAid advocacy agenda
* receive information/news as background to the action to take
* show solidarity with an issue / group
* show solidarity with an issue / group by help funding action
* show solidarity by becoming a regular giver
* sign up for membership in ActionAid
* access different tools for social mobilization
* share anything in their wider networks
* adapt preferences so that the user is only in the loop of what she/he is interested in

### Goals
To have a digital platform which can provide strategic options for people to engage in issues of social justice in Sweden and abroad, tapping in to energy that today often doesnâ€™t have an outlet. The aim is that it will make the work of ActionAid more rooted and more effective in our pursuit for social justice.

### End-user
ActionAid members, activists, volunteers, people on mailing-lists, the public. Anybody that shares our fundamental values and wish to be part of a movement set to fight social injustices.

### Requirements
An application for smart-phone able to reach as many normal users as possible.
