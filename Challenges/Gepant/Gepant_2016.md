### Brief description
Increase the recycling of metal cans and PET bottles in Sweden through innovative digital solutions.

### Background
Gepant have created an easy-to-use platform that enables individuals and companies to support sport and other non profit organizations in their local area. The platform connects citizens and companies that seek to save time but also to make a social and financial contribution to local organizations. Gepant makes the fund-raising simple and fun, and at the same time creates a win-win situation for both user groups for the platform, and of course while it contributes a great benefit for the Swedish environment. Gepant is a social and environmental innovation ‐ a facilitator that aims to increase Sweden’s recycling rate, non-profitable organizations financial situation and citizens and companies ease of acquisition. The platform enables “supporters” – citizens and companies and “organisations” – sport/activities organizations, to generate value in mutual benefits for both parts. Meaning, if supporters does not wish to return their cans/bottles for refund, Gepant enables an easy service to donate the refund to a local organization. Or, if the organisations have a tough time to find financial support, Gepant provide them visibility on the platform to increase supporters for the organization. It works as the “organisation” registers on Gepant’s platform with their contact details, objective and goal. “Supporter’ on the other hand navigates to Gepant’s platform and registers their contact details, approximate number of cans/bottles, selects the organization to support and when they want it to be picked up. Donation is then done and collectors pick up the cans/bottles.

### Challenge
As for many other small platform businesses, the biggest challenge is to continuously create value within and across new users of the system. We want Gepants’ users to be motivated to continuously use our platform for their service and to frequently visit the website but also Facebook and Instagram. Our challenges can be addressed as:
* To make a greater interaction between individuals and companies that have bottle/cans refunds with non-profitable organizations that search for bottle/cans refunds.
→ To make it possible for the non-profitable organizations to print out Gepant material straight from our website in order to be used for increasing the collection rate of bottle/cans refund but also to marketing our platform and service.
* To find new ways on how to make the platform more accessible to individuals and companies to increase their use of the platform. This could be, for instance to give “supporters’” points in form of badges as a rewarding system for their contribution of bottles/cans refund donation to a local sport/activity organization. This kind of rewarding system should be visible for all users of the platform in order to increase the motivation to continuously support local organizations. Furthermore, the idea can be developed to separate the rewarding system so that companies have one kind of system (which will be connected to our future business model of certification system), and a system for private citizens that acts as supporters for local organizations.
* To develop website further into an easy-to-use tool for the donors to make more donations straight on their phone (eventually make an app). Also, to give the collectors the ability to track their donation on their phone.

### Goals
We would like to reach a complete clean Sweden from softdrinks metal cans and PET bottles by providing an innovative way of recycling and fund-raising. Our first target is to rise the number of recycled cans and bottles through Gepant’s platform with 1 million. In Sweden we recycle around 84% of all cans and bottles out there. The remaining 16 % stands for 188 000 000 cans and bottles that does not get recycled. We want to change that and raise the number of recycled cans and bottles by making it more accessible to the ones that are not recycled today to donate their cans and support local organization.

### End-user
We have three end users:
1. The organizations that receives the fund-raising through the supporters bottles/cans refund.
2. The supporters that save time and want to make a social contribution to a local sport/activity organizations.
3. Lastly, the recycling companies who finally receives the bottles/cans for their recycling processes.
