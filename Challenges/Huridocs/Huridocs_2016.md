### Brief description
Detect patterns of discrimination in written natural language

### Background
HURIDOCS is an international NGO supporting human rights organizations with information management and the usage of technology. In my internship we investigated how machine learning techniques can help to understand collections of documents and to facilitate their accessibility for human rights advocates, organizations and institutions. With our partner ICAAD, the International Center for Advocates against Discrimination, we are facing a very interesting challenge: In their last report, they showed that gender stereotypes and discriminatory practices have considerable influence on judicial sentences in the Pacific Islands. Especially in domestic violence and sexual assault cases stereotyped arguments, like ‘my wife is suspected of having an affair’ or cultural practices like reconciliation ceremonies which often exclude the victim, are brought up to defend the perpetrator and reduce punishment. The consideration of gender stereotypes, rape myths or discriminatory practices in legal institutions leaves victims disempowered, vulnerable and without faith in a justice system that should be protecting them. Therefore, it is important to detect and reveal patterns of systematic discrimination. However, extracting relevant patterns is labor intense and so far, mainly done manually which limits the scope of research in this field. In this challenge we want to explore the possibility to automatically identify patterns of discrimination and extract relevant information from specific documents.

### Challenge
In this challenge we want to investigate how discrimination is expressed in written natural language and explore approaches to detect these patterns. We provide the dataset which builds the basis for ICAADs report on the ‘Analysis of judicial sentencing practices in sexual and gender-based violence cases in the Pacific Island Region’. It contains about 7000 case laws with their full text and additional properties like the court, the topic of the case, the applied legal code, the frequency of relevant words like reconciliation, etc… About 600 of these cases are about sexual assault or domestic violence. From the ICAAD report we know in some of these cases gender stereotypes are raised to justify a crime. Is it possible to identify these cases and to extract information about how they influence the final sentence, e.g. are they considered or dismissed by the judge? Can we derive insights about how patterns of discrimination are expressed in written natural language? What are possible approaches to automatically detect them?

### Goal
The automatic detection of discriminatory arguments in case law, speeds up the whole process of document analysis such that it is feasible to expand the research done by ICAAD to other countries. Regarding their results which show a significant influence of gender stereotypes on judicial sentencing in the Pacific Islands, further analysis is important to quantitatively proof this issues, raise awareness and combat systematic discrimination.

### End-user
For this specific project, we will directly make use from the ideas and methods developed during the hackathon. In collaboration with ICAAD we will use these insights to facilitate the detection of affected cases and make a broader research in more countries and with different cases possible.
