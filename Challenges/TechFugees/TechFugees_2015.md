### Background
Techfugees is a tech community, formed in response to the refugee crisis currently ongoing in Europe. Recently they have organized two hackathons, one in London and one in Berlin.

At Hackpad.com you can find Outcomes from these hackathons, which you may use for inspiration or work further on. 

Below we present the Challenges communicated during these events , which are still very much relevant and in need of your attention.

### Challenges
* Refugees are being separated from friends and family as they flee Syria. Build a way for them to locate and reunite with each other.
* There are currently countless incidents of war crimes and crimes against people that are going unrecorded and reported. Build a way to record and report the time and location of crime against refugees.
* The displayed people of Syria are not represented by anyone and have no democratic collective voice. Build a way for them, and anyone who choose to represent them, to be heard so that their actual needs are met, and not those we suppose they have.
* Build an application that allows users to work out safe routes of passage, allowing refugees to share safe ways to reach their destination.
* Aggregate country specific asylum and immigration information. Sweden has an excellent website with an asylum “pre-application” which allows people to try and figure out how probable it is for them to be granted asylum by Sweden should they make it there. Look for ways to scrape this information and produce and API from other country data.
* Aggregate information that allows people to access info on asylum requirements and procedures and country by country. Information on rights and benefits could help refugees figure out the best place to go. It will also allow those who are not in fear of their lives but are making the journey for economic reasons to get a more realistic idea of what life is like in respective European countries and perhaps make the decision that since their lives are not at risk, they may be better off staying where they are.
