### Background
We recruit monthly donors through direct dialogue, (face-to-face, knocking on doors, etc.) Today we utilize with counterfoils (direct debit concessions/standing order/autogiro) that are made of paper but would like to digitize our method. If we digitize, the feedback to our donors will be much quicker, our teamleader can work more efficiently with the registrations, and the system will become much less vulnerable  when we do not have to deal with paper counterfoils.

### Challenge

Challenges will be to find a way to store signatures.
As our IT systems are structured today, this is a first step towards testing the method to digitize our recruitment of donors. Today we can not send our concessions directly into CRM without the need to extract these manually and register them.

As the idea is, it needs to be an app where the donor can sign the direct debit consent with his/hers finger or with a pen. The counterfoil is directly transformed into a PDF and then sent by email to the donor as a “receipt” of the consent.

### Goals

In the future, we would like to see results as:
* Can we see in which areas we have recruited most monthly donors?
* Can we see what times of day that we recruit the most people?
* Can we completely digitize the reregistration of monthly donors so we do not have to manually enter the information in our CRM system?
* Can we have a mapsystem in this app? When we knock on doors?

### Possible End-user

* Recruiters out on the street / at the doors.
* There needs to be an easy to navigate app that many people can use regardless previously computer experiences.

### Requirements

* To be used on Androids
* But in the long term – would like to integrate the system to CRM (Customer Relationship Management, Windows if possible…).

The instructions in the form should be in:
* Swedish
* English as an selectable option (or other languages in the long term)
