### Background
Missing family members separated by war and conflict can be traced by the help of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world.  The present tool we use today, to collect data about missing persons, is a tracing request paper form which is filled out during an interview with the enquirer. To the paper form different appendix are attached depending on which country or region the sought person(s) are believed to be found. We often use volunteers to conduct these interviews. The challenge is to cover all necessary questions in a certain order and to pin point the data related to the separation.

### Challenge
All data collected is written with Latin letters. Names should be crosschecked with a name dictionary in order to minimize name variations. All names should be transcribed into original written language. Last known addresses should be expressed with Latin letters and in original written language and if possible marked on satellite map. Hand written maps can also be collected and attached. The data to be collected varies based on the region/country of last known address e.g. when tracing in Somalia additional information related to the clan system is collected. Photos of the enquirer and the sought person should be possible to attach. Every section of questions should have an available guide which explains the purpose of the questions in text or as YouTube clips. When all data is collected the interviewed person has to give consent to the Red Cross to use the information. A Red Cross Message, a personal message containing family news, are often collected during the interview and transmitted together with the tracing request.

### Goals
* Increase the quality of collected data about missing persons.
* Speed up and simplify the case registration process by using a digital tool to collect data.
* Import/export function with present case management system (FLAnswers)
* A self-instructing tool that will reduce the hours of training volunteers.
* An application that can be run on an iPad or Tablet.

### Possible End-user
The tool will be used by Red Cross volunteers and Red Cross Staff to collect data from persons, during interviews, who has lost contact with their loved ones due to war and conflict.

The data collected by the tool will be processed and transmitted to the Red Cross or Red Crescent in the region where the missing persons are assumed to be.

### Special Requirements

The platform for Swedish Red Cross is Windows.
