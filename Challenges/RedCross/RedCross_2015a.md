### Background
SRC has many volunteers involved in various activities related to the refugee crisis. All volunteers needs to be coordinated according to needs, activities and competences.
Today’s systems and platforms, our volunteer database, or the volunteer agency are based on fact that we publish an advertisement, interested persons respond and send in their applications, the NGO manage o administer the notifications (which claims large resources). Especially in times of acute crisis, it is increasingly difficult to find time to match the right skills for various missions. We need to change that.

### Challenge
It should be easy for volunteers to sign up for a local activity. Today we do not see what skills a volunteer has and we can not send out a request for volunteers within a limited geographical area / skills in a simple way.
1. The system is to be used internally within the SRC, but other organizations should also be able to linked up to the system = we get better interaction as it is often the same people who are the subject of recruitment. All volunteers should register their own data incl. competences
3. The system must include the possibility of setting the requirement to specific skills for certain assignments.
4. The system should be able to see where volunteers are located geographically or can work
5. The system should be able to send messages via SMS and email to the target group volunt.
6. Competence steered – the coordinator sees all the info, volunteer their own data + assignm.
7. Start page where the volunteers can find all current missions
8. Mission page – each mission has its own infopage with schedule and a chatfunction

### Goals
By streamlining the registration of volunteers in respect of operations based on the above, it will be faster and easier to match volunteers with the right skills to current missions.
Everything is facilitated by the volunteer who sign in using personal codes to create their own profile where all data including proficiency is registered. The volunteer also register his/hers interest in various missions directly in the system. Volunteer coordinator approves all assignments, which creates a clarity and control. Streamlining of volunteer management.

### Potential End-user
Local associations, volunteers, volunteer coordinator, employees of the organization who provides support to the volunteers in their mission.

### Optional Requirements
* Window based system
* Web based application that do not require downloading
* Responsive design
