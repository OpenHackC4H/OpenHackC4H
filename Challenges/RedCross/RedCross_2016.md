### Brief description
Create a new dynamism and enhance communication and learning among volunteers and the people we serve.

### Background
The Red Cross is the worldâ€™s premier humanitarian organization. We are found all over the world in every single country and are comprised of millions of volunteers who decided to help other people. We are fighting every day in all countries to save lives and give hope.

### Challenge
The Swedish Red Cross like many other organizations in Sweden responded to the influx of migrants during the last year. As always we rely on the strength of our movement and the commitment and drive of our volunteers. They are our greatest strength but this experience has shown that we are slow to harness the power of an emerging and energetic social movement and are losing out to other actors that can coalesce around single issues and respond more immediately. We believe in our strengths and the quality of our long term, well planned work but we need a new drive and new energy to take this work further. Another area we could improve is having the people we serve feedback on and shape the services they are receiving. The most relevant and effective way to support people in distress is to support them to find ways of helping themselves. Creating space for vulnerable people to communicate with us, shape our programmes and feedback on our progress is the most direct way to do this. Ideally we seek a web based mobile based tool that would allow volunteers to share experiences and skills directly with each other, grow in their experience of engaging with the Red Cross and for people in our various target groups to find out how they can influence our programmes and what they receive as services but also find ways of contributing and getting involved. The tool can be initially confined to Sweden almost as a pilot test and then rolled out across the movement (globally) if it is successful. We see it as a combination of a communication platform, a learning platform where staff and volunteers can share information, links and mobile and web based learning tools, and a accountability mechanism where people in society and especially those in our target populations can feedback and engage.

### Goals
As a social movement with a long history and a humanitarian organization with global expertise we believe this tool could fire up our base, fire up our foundational members and allow us to be more responsive to a changing society around us, both in Sweden and further afield.

### End-user
Red Cross Volunteers and people receiving support from the Red Cross
