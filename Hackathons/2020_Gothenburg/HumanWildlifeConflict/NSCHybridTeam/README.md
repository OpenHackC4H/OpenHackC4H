OPENHACK CODING FOR HUMANITY
TEAM 8 – NSC Hybrid Team

PROBLEM
People living in and around LNP (National Park in Mozambique, southern Africa) are poor, vulnerable and at risk. They survive through subsistence farming and are often exposed to wild African elephants that approach villages and fields, destroying crops or perhaps a year’s worth of food.
The two main problems we will focus is addressing are:
How to keep elephants in wild
How to better escalate, communicate and alert to the communities
CASE GOAL DESCRIPTION
To develop new or expand on existing technology that is affordable and accessible.
How can community members:
Be empowered to proactively mitigate and respond to HWC; 
Receive early notifications in the event of elephants moving within proximity of their crops and villages; 
Inform Park authorities if elephants are near their crops or villages; 
Use technology to deter elephants from coming near their crops or villages / to protect themselves against HWC incidents with elephants; 
Use technology to learn more about HWC and how to reduce the risk of coming in conflict with elephants and other species; or 
Communicate in real-time with relevant authorities to elicit support. 
An additional goal would be to explore how existing technologies such as geo-fencing, LoRaWAN, and sensors can be made more accessible and affordable so that it can be used in LNP.
SOLUTION DESCRIPTION

The solution is based on escalating zones concept
These zones are backed by technology, wise communication, and training
Each zone triggers different actions. The objectives are:
Zone 1 : Keep elephants in wild – Ex.: send subsonic sound waves
Zone 2 : Escalations messages – Ex.: notify stakeholders, bee-vehicle,  different sounds
Zone 3 : Alert humans – Ex.: information & sound alerts, “non-violent get out now”

The solution proposes a Sensor Platform and Action Platform that combined achieve our goals.
One system =  3 zones coverage + Sensor Platform of 4 km radius + Action Platform


The Sensor platform is an infra-structure of sensors, cameras and close connectivity (no internet / low power), distributed in a circle area of 4km radius. It identifies location of elephants’ (via earth signal) in the zones and sends signal to the Action platform. This platform also will have some cameras with the objective to capture the wild elephants and get financial incentive to the project.
The Action platform is a system with different software and hardware devices that will trigger different actions per zone, as for example:
Zone 1
Discover elephant
Listen & match low frequency
Capture images/videos 
Trigger low frequency noise to elephants
Update zone status in control SW
LED panels & live dashboards
Zone 2
Alert key resources, stakeholders
Trigger different noises to scare elephants
Alert zone status in control SW
LED panels & live dashboards
Zone 3
SMS alerts to humans
Alert rangers, medical team, animal transporters
Trigger audible sounds to humans

The solution proposal of a radio of 4 km, has been calculated considering that elephants are walking (elephants walks 8 km per hour) and that would give roughly a 30 min heads-up to humans.
The cost of the solution is estimated considering the development in Sri Lanka, where there is expertise around elephants, this solution & technologies and low cost for SW and HW implementation.
We have also added a high-level suggestion in how to finance the project in the presentation.
