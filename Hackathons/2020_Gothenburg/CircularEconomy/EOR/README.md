Ease of recycling app
https://github.com/lucasnordic/BarcodeQRScanner

Problem:
Manufacture companies are not encouraged to use recycled materials.
Consumers do not have any clues about the materials used in their products.
There is no easy way for consumers to tell what is in a product, where it is from and if it is recyclable.


Solution:
Use a barcode/QR-code scanner application on mobile phones
Manufacture companies need to put a barcode/QR code on their items.
Everyone has a phone and access to apps.
A user friendly app.
Accessibility to both Barcode and QR-code scanner.
Website for more detailed accessibility.


Idea behind the code:
https://github.com/lucasnordic/BarcodeQRScanner
To develop an app with the help of open source libraries that can scan Barcode, QR-code or any other custom code. 
To develop it in either Java or Javascript/Typescript/React in order to make it accessible both as an app and on a website.
